                <p>I love learning new things, all the time! From extra-curricular activities, to online certifications,
                to even going on a year abroad to The University of Texas at Austin!<br> Here are some of the stuff I have done
                over the past few years</p>

                        <p>I decided to go on a year abroad, after a very positive experience I had had in my teenage years when I went to live to the UK for almost 5 years.
                        It is in this time where I felt I learnt the most, and so it was time to do it as a young adult. To live away from family and comfort. <br><br>
                        My experience there was nothing but the best. I created friends for life, grew as a person and came away with many stories to tell. <br><br>I was able to
                        take courses I was extremely passionate about like cinema and psychology, but was also able to learn from one of the best Computer Science universities
                        in the world, in courses such as Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics.</p>

                            I felt it was time to dig deeper and understand how to manipulate data and incorporate it into my own websites.

                        <p> Since my previous experiences had been with small to medium companies I started searching for different ways I could help them grow.
                        I came across Google Garage, a course focused into bringing your business online, which taught me all the basics from tools like
                        Google MyBusiness to things such as SEO.<br><br> The name of the course was Google Garage: The Fundamentals of Digital Marketing. </p>
